MMQB
====

MondayMorning QuarterBacks is a video game written in Java/Processing where you can destroy the worst QB critics!

This game features a protagonist sprite character “QB” who resembles a football

quarterback. He throws footballs at oncoming Monday morning quarterbacks 

who remain seated in couches. The Monday morning invaders approach QB and 

munch on chips and drink beer whose flying crumbs and noxious belch gas hurts 

our QB. The player’s job is to guide QB left and right in the “pocket” while avoiding 

these obstacles and also throwing footballs at the oncoming enemies. Note! Once an 

enemy is hit by a football he falls backward and his couch then becomes an obstacle 

to other advancing enemies.

Levels progress by increases the speed and intensity of the onslaught of Monday 

morning quarterbacks.
